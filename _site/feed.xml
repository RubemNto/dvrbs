documentation accompanied by the source code itself. Sure, it made the project much bigger than it needed to be, and many times what was written was outdated or outwrite wrong.
But for most of our college years, that documentation saved us.</p>

<p align="center">
<sup><sup>Example source code from OpenGL project from college</sup></sup>
</p>

<p>Now, what if we could improve this coding style, not only making it better looking, but also better to read and smaller files overall?
And what if we could use our language of choice and keep using our favorite stack? And as icing on top keep all our projects available on the cloud so all our team members can see?
That my friend is no myth, is <strong>org-mode</strong> + <strong>org files</strong> + <strong>emacs</strong>.</p>

<h1 id="project-structure">Project structure</h1>

<p>For this example project, we will be making a small cli calculator for addition, subtraction, division and multiplication between only two numbres.
As the plan is to make it cross platform, I’ll be using CMake and C++, but all languages for any programming stack apply to this method, up to what I know. So feel free to use and test what
you like and let me know how it was.</p>

<p>For this project, the structure will be as follows:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">org-math/
├── bin
├── CMakeLists.org
└── src
    ├── main.org
    └── math.org</code></pre></figure>

<p>As we can see we replaced all of our file extensions from all of our files and used only org for this, from which we will take advantage of it to use emacs and org-mode. 
Let us begin with the source part, shall we?</p>

<h1 id="header-files">Header files</h1>

<p>As most C++ projects found in nature, in here we will start by working on the header files of the project to make our math cli tool.
For this, in my math.org file I will start by including the important metadata for this file.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-cpp" data-lang="cpp"><span class="cp">#+TITLE: math.h
#+AUTHOR: dvrbs
#+DATE: 2024-04-01
</span>
<span class="cp">#+OPTIONS: num:nil toc:nil timestamp:nil
</span>
<span class="cp">#+PROPERTY: header-args :tangle math.h</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>In here, we can already have an idea of what this file is and what it will become in the future.
For a better idea, let us look at the options section.
In it, we can see we made some alteration to the export options of the file, where, to take advantage of the tools for exporting our files to the web, and make it readable,
we removed the number listing of the topics of the files, the table of contents at the begining of the files and the timestamp information. With this, we ensure our source code
is readable in most devices and allows for a more minimalistic look to it.</p>

<p>Next comes the methods we will use for our CLI tool.
To take advantage of org-modes syntax highlighting capabilities, let us add all of our methods to code blocks indicating that it is C++ code. It should look something like this.</p>

<p>As we can see, all of the Functions are nice and ready to be called, but it is missing something. The documentation.
Before org, our documentation lived inside of our source code, cluthering our project and sometimes, not even doing nothing usefull, 
like commenting old code or some TODO topic that will never be done.</p>

<p>For us to add the documentation to the functions, my style is to have the title of the function accompanied by its parameters and than a description of what it does.
In the end we will have something like this.</p>

<p>Now that we have the header file ready, let us take a look at the source cpp file.</p>

<h1 id="source-files">Source files</h1>

<p>Similar to the header files before, first we add the metadata again but now we have to change the tangle output file to main.cc. On main.org we will have something like this.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-cpp" data-lang="cpp"><span class="cp">#+TITLE: main.cc
#+AUTHOR: dvrbs

</span>
<span class="cp">#+OPTIONS: num:nil toc:nil timestamp:nil
</span>
<span class="cp">#+PROPERTY: header-args :tangle main.cc</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Next, we have to add the include files to main. For this, let us add another cpp code block, include the files and describe this part of the code as “Include package”</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-cpp" data-lang="cpp"><span class="p">...</span>
<span class="o">*</span> <span class="n">include</span> <span class="n">packages</span>

</span>  <span class="cp">#include</span> <span class="cpf">"math.h"</span><span class="cp">
#+end_src</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>And for a simple demonstration of the tool, we will add the final code block for the main function of the program. Once again we will describe the block but now as “main program”</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-cpp" data-lang="cpp"><span class="p">...</span>

<span class="cp">#+end_src</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Will both source and header files ready, it is time for us to compile the program and test it in a console.</p>

<h1 id="build">Build</h1>

<p>As we are making a cross platform program, we will open the CMakeList.org file and paste this to it.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-cmake" data-lang="cmake"><span class="c1">#+TITLE: CMakeLists.txt </span>

<span class="c1">#+end_src</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Next we have now to tangle all of the files we have created to their respective code files to be compiled.
The easiest way to do this is as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Open the file</li>
  <li>At the beginning of the file, type the command C-c C-c</li>
  <li>type the command M-x org-babel-tangle</li>
</ul>

<p>If all files were created, now we should have something like this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-txt">org-math/
├── bin
├── CMakeLists.org
├── CMakeLists.txt
└── src
    ├── main.cc
    ├── main.org
    ├── math.h
    └── math.org
</code></pre>

<p>If we now check the newly generated files, we will see that they are all normal and simple code files like any other, but now are clean and have no documentation on them.
To test if this work, let us compile it and run on our console.</p>

<p>To compile a cmake project, firt in the root of our project in the console, we run the command:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">$ </span>CMake <span class="nt">-S</span> <span class="nb">.</span> <span class="nt">-B</span> bin.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Next, we go to the bin directory and run the make command:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">cd </span>bin
<span class="nv">$ </span>make
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now run the org-math project we created and we are finished. We have made a project with nothing but org files, org mode and got easy to read documentation that can be read
as org files that will be fine, but we could also have it online on the cloud or on git repository services like gitlab and github.
Below we have an example of org files rendered as html documentation.</p>

  <p>“Control, control, you must learn control!” – Master Yoda</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In “Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back,” Master Yoda imparts this wisdom to Luke Skywalker during his training on Dagobah, underscoring the significance of mastering one’s emotions and maintaining control, particularly in the utilization of the Force. This counsel, applicable not only to Force wielders, proves highly beneficial for programmers and their code.</p>

<p>Drawing inspiration from the iconic communication style of the fictional character, Yoda conditioning represents a programming approach dedicated to rectifying minor and inconvenient issues in everyday programming practices, such as typos. Let us witness it in action within real code. Can you identify the error in less than five seconds?</p>

<p>Did you spot it? I presume you did. Nevertheless, just to ensure, here it is:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-cpp" data-lang="cpp"><span class="kt">bool</span> <span class="nf">PetIsHungry</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">PetInfo</span> <span class="n">info</span><span class="p">){</span>
  <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">info</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">hunger</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mf">0.5</span><span class="p">){</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nb">true</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="p">}</span>
  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nb">false</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>As we have all likely experienced at some juncture, a typo within a conditional has been made. In this instance, the omission of the “&gt;” symbol is evident. This oversight results in the program failing to execute a comparison, instead executing a true conditional, where we enter the conditional block with the hunger value now assigned as 0.5. While this is a minor and easily remedied issue, it may go unnoticed during compile time, necessitating manual inspection of the code for correction. While this example may seem straightforward, within larger projects involving teams, such typos can swiftly become problematic. So, how can this be mitigated? Enter Yoda conditional.</p>

<p>This approach posits that, as compile-time constants cannot be assigned values, structuring conditionals to check if constants are identical or adhere to a pattern with variables reduces the likelihood of a program compiling with such errors in the binary. Let’s revisit the above example:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-cpp" data-lang="cpp"><span class="kt">bool</span> <span class="nf">PetIsHungry</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">PetInfo</span> <span class="n">info</span><span class="p">){</span>
  <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="mf">0.5</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">info</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">hunger</span><span class="p">){</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nb">true</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="p">}</span>
  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nb">false</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Now, the compiler will prohibit compilation, indicating that the assignment of values must adhere to the operand left-to-right notation, i.e., Variable operand value. While this solution works, when should it be employed? This question arises because, as you may have observed, this style lacks readability and may impede collaborative efforts within a team, akin to Luke Skywalker’s struggles in mastering the ways of the Force with his mentor.</p>

<p>In my estimation, it is prudent to utilize this notation as a tool for prototyping and testing software during the draft stages of production code. Yoda conditioning should never be deployed in production unless unanimously agreed upon by all team members. Once the software has undergone thorough testing and scrutiny, the final version should be rendered without this style, employing conventional conditioning instead.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="code" /><category term="typos" /><category term="conditioning" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[“Control, control, you must learn control!” – Master Yoda]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">I like clean code</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/opinion/tech/2024/03/26/I-like-clean-code.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="I like clean code" /><published>2024-03-26T21:07:45-03:00</published><updated>2024-03-26T21:07:45-03:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/opinion/tech/2024/03/26/I-like-clean-code</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/opinion/tech/2024/03/26/I-like-clean-code.html"><![CDATA[<p>I find myself drawn to “Clean Code” with an almost magnetic pull.

With a modest typing speed barely scratching 50 Words Per Minute (WPM), I’ve affectionately dubbed myself a “chicken typer” – a whimsical term encapsulating my haphazard and lethargic typing style.</p>

<p>In my quest for improvement, I embarked on the journey of touch typing, armed with the ubiquitous QWERTY layout. I explored an array of online tools – MonkeyType, ztype, typing fighters, to name a few – in a valiant attempt to refine my skills. Yet, despite my earnest endeavors, progress remained elusive. Even worse, prolonged periods of inactivity often saw my typing abilities regress, leaving me more frustrated than before.</p>

<p>In a moment of introspection, I pondered the influence of my choice of keyboard on my typing woes. Could a departure from the standard layout usher in a newfound era of proficiency? Thus, I ventured into the realm of compact keyboards, opting for a Redragon 60% keyboard sans the luxury of arrow keys. Sacrificing convenience for portability and precision, I bid farewell to the familiarity of full-size membrane keyboards or the distinct click of Cherry MX Blue switches.</p>

<p>To my surprise, the Redragon keyboard proved to be a revelation, offering unparalleled comfort and functionality. It served as an ideal entry point for casual gaming and programming alike, boasting a blend of efficiency and compactness. However, despite the allure of this new hardware, my typing skills remained stubbornly stagnant, if not regressing, in the initial stages of adaptation.</p>

<p>Frustrated by my lack of progress, I flirted with the idea of reverting to my trusty laptop keyboard – a sanctuary of familiarity in a sea of uncertainty. Yet, it was during this period of contemplation that fate intervened in the form of the DVORAK keyboard layout.</p>

<p>Unlike its predecessors, DVORAK presented a unique challenge. The initial foray into this unfamiliar territory was marred by abysmal typing speeds – barely cresting 10 WPM on platforms like MonkeyType. Precision became a daunting hurdle, with my accuracy plummeting to a mere 40 to 50% on a layout map. Yet, undeterred by these setbacks, I resolved to persevere.</p>

<p>As weeks turned into months, I immersed myself in the DVORAK layout, embracing its quirks and idiosyncrasies. From workstations to smartphones, I integrated DVORAK into every facet of my typing routine. Slowly but surely, progress emerged from the ashes of frustration, with my WPM soaring to unprecedented heights within a scant three months.</p>

<p>Today, after over five months of unwavering dedication, I stand as a testament to the transformative power of the DVORAK layout. But what sets DVORAK apart from its predecessors?</p>

<p>For me, the answer lies in its departure from convention. Unlike the familiar confines of QWERTY, DVORAK challenged my reliance on visual cues, fostering a deeper understanding of typing mechanics.</p>

<p>In conclusion, my transition to the DVORAK layout has been nothing short of revolutionary, and I harbor no intentions of returning to QWERTY any time soon.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ah, the perpetual struggle of a slow typist – a title I’ve begrudgingly worn for much of my life.
