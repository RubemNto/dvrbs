Ah, the perpetual struggle of a slow typist – a title I've begrudgingly worn for much of my life. With a modest typing speed barely scratching 50 Words Per Minute (WPM), I've affectionately dubbed myself a "chicken typer" – a whimsical term encapsulating my haphazard and lethargic typing style.

In my quest for improvement, I embarked on the journey of touch typing, armed with the ubiquitous QWERTY layout. I explored an array of online tools – MonkeyType, ztype, typing fighters, to name a few – in a valiant attempt to refine my skills. Yet, despite my earnest endeavors, progress remained elusive. Even worse, prolonged periods of inactivity often saw my typing abilities regress, leaving me more frustrated than before.

In a moment of introspection, I pondered the influence of my choice of keyboard on my typing woes. Could a departure from the standard layout usher in a newfound era of proficiency? Thus, I ventured into the realm of compact keyboards, opting for a Redragon 60% keyboard sans the luxury of arrow keys. Sacrificing convenience for portability and precision, I bid farewell to the familiarity of full-size membrane keyboards or the distinct click of Cherry MX Blue switches.

To my surprise, the Redragon keyboard proved to be a revelation, offering unparalleled comfort and functionality. It served as an ideal entry point for casual gaming and programming alike, boasting a blend of efficiency and compactness. However, despite the allure of this new hardware, my typing skills remained stubbornly stagnant, if not regressing, in the initial stages of adaptation.

Frustrated by my lack of progress, I flirted with the idea of reverting to my trusty laptop keyboard – a sanctuary of familiarity in a sea of uncertainty. Yet, it was during this period of contemplation that fate intervened in the form of the DVORAK keyboard layout.

Unlike its predecessors, DVORAK presented a unique challenge. The initial foray into this unfamiliar territory was marred by abysmal typing speeds – barely cresting 10 WPM on platforms like MonkeyType. Precision became a daunting hurdle, with my accuracy plummeting to a mere 40 to 50% on a layout map. Yet, undeterred by these setbacks, I resolved to persevere.

As weeks turned into months, I immersed myself in the DVORAK layout, embracing its quirks and idiosyncrasies. From workstations to smartphones, I integrated DVORAK into every facet of my typing routine. Slowly but surely, progress emerged from the ashes of frustration, with my WPM soaring to unprecedented heights within a scant three months.

Today, after over five months of unwavering dedication, I stand as a testament to the transformative power of the DVORAK layout. But what sets DVORAK apart from its predecessors?

For me, the answer lies in its departure from convention. Unlike the familiar confines of QWERTY, DVORAK challenged my reliance on visual cues, fostering a deeper understanding of typing mechanics.

In conclusion, my transition to the DVORAK layout has been nothing short of revolutionary, and I harbor no intentions of returning to QWERTY any time soon.
