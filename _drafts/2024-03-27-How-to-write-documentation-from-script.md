the best documetation is the source code you write

good developers read documentation first and than write code

good developers know that they are stupid and need help. Don't be stupid and ask for help when needed.

documentation is one of if not the most important aspect of a project that you desire to go the distance. Now wouldnt it be great if we could blend working in our projects and at the same time write not only good documentation
that also looks good?

Well, here are my tips on what good source documentation looks like and to turn your source code into accessible web documontation.

## Good source code is the best documentation
## Documentation should be as descriptive as possible
## Documentation should be clean and to the point
## Don't hide documentation to developers only, have them available to all readers and users
## Good documentation should guide the developers first and the users second
